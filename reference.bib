  abstract  = {The COVID-19 pandemic has created an urgent need for models that can project epidemic trends, explore intervention scenarios, and estimate resource needs. Here we describe the methodology of Covasim (COVID-19 Agent-based Simulator), an open-source model developed to help address these questions. Covasim includes country-specific demographic information on age structure and population size; realistic transmission networks in different social layers, including households, schools, workplaces, long-term care facilities, and communities; age-specific disease outcomes; and intrahost viral dynamics, including viral-load-based transmissibility. Covasim also supports an extensive set of interventions, including non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as physical distancing and protective equipment; pharmaceutical interventions, including vaccination; and testing interventions, such as symptomatic and asymptomatic testing, isolation, contact tracing, and quarantine. These interventions can incorporate the effects of delays, loss-to-follow-up, micro-targeting, and other factors. Implemented in pure Python, Covasim has been designed with equal emphasis on performance, ease of use, and flexibility: realistic and highly customized scenarios can be run on a standard laptop in under a minute. In collaboration with local health agencies and policymakers, Covasim has already been applied to examine epidemic dynamics and inform policy decisions in more than a dozen countries in Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, and North America.},

  abstract  = {We describe an experimental setup and a currently running experiment for evaluating how physical interactions over time and between individuals affect the spread of epidemics. Our experiment involves the voluntary use of the Safe Blues Android app by participants at The University of Auckland (UoA) City Campus in New Zealand. The app spreads multiple virtual safe virus strands via Bluetooth depending on the physical proximity of the subjects. The evolution of the virtual epidemics is recorded as they spread through the population. The data is presented as a real-time (and historical) dashboard. A simulation model is applied to calibrate strand parameters. Participants’ locations are not recorded, but participants are rewarded based on the duration of participation within a geofenced area, and aggregate participation numbers serve as part of the data. The 2021 experimental data is available as an open-source anonymized dataset, and once the experiment is complete, the remaining data will be made available. This paper outlines the experimental setup, software, subject-recruitment practices, ethical considerations, and dataset description. The paper also highlights current experimental results in view of the lockdown that started in New Zealand at 23:59 on August 17, 2021. The experiment was initially planned in the New Zealand environment, expected to be free of COVID and lockdowns after 2020. However, a COVID Delta strain lockdown shuffled the cards and the experiment is currently extended into 2022.},

  abstract  = {Context Epidemiology is a discipline which has evolved with the changes taking place in society and the emergence of new diseases and new discipline related to epidemiology. With these evolutions, it is important to understand epidemiology and to analyse the evolution of content of definitions of epidemiology.   Objectives The main objective of this paper was to identify new definitions of epidemiology available since 1978. Secondary objectives were to analyse the content of these definitions, to compare them with those used by Lilienfeld and to determine whether changes have taken place over the last forty years.   Methods A review of grey literature and published literature was conducted to find the definitions of epidemiology written between 1978 and 2017.   Results 102 definitions of epidemiology were retained. They helped to highlight 20 terms and concepts related to epidemiology. Most of them were already used in the definitions used by Lilienfeld. Five terms were present in more than 50 percent of definitions from the period 1978 to 2017: “population”, “study”, “disease”, “health” and “distribution”. Several developments have occurred: strengthening of the terms “control” and “health” already used, the concept of “disease” was less frequently encountered whereas the concepts “infectious diseases”, “mass phenomenon” are no longer used in definitions from 1978 to 2017.   Conclusion This evolution of content of definition of epidemiology is absent from books on epidemiology. A thematic analysis of definitions of epidemiology could be conducted in order to improve our understanding of changes observed.},

Three different types of stochastic model formulations are discussed: discrete time Markov chain, continuous time Markov chain and stochastic differential equations. Properties unique to the stochastic models are presented: probability of disease extinction, probability of disease outbreak, quasistationary probability distribution, final size distribution, and expected duration of an epidemic. The chapter ends with a discussion of two stochastic formulations that cannot be directly related to the SIS and SIR epidemic models. They are discrete time Markov chain formulations applied in the study of epidemics within households (chain binomial models) and in the prediction of the initial spread of an epidemic (branching processes).},

This ABS provides information about risk and the effects of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, as well as detailed control over the rapidly evolving epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Simulation results can inform decisions made by facility administrators and be used as inputs for a complementary decision support system. The application of our ABS to our research lab environment as a proof of concept demonstrates the configurability and insights achievable with this form of modeling, with future work focused on extensibility and integration with decision support.},

              Viral spread is a complicated function of biological properties, the environment, preventative measures such as sanitation and masks, and the rate at which individuals come within physical proximity. It is these last two elements that governments can control through social-distancing directives. However, infection measurements are almost always delayed, making real-time estimation nearly impossible. Safe Blues is one way of addressing the problem caused by this time lag via online measurements combined with machine learning methods that exploit the relationship between counts of multiple forms of the Safe Blues strands and the progress of the actual epidemic. The Safe Blues protocols and techniques have been developed together with an experimental minimal viable product, presented as an app on Android devices with a server backend. Following initial exploration via simulation experiments, we are now preparing for a university-wide experiment of Safe Blues.},

Beyond the inherent capabilities of adding domain knowledge into learning systems, CML provides a complete toolset for investigating how a system would react to an intervention (e.g. outcome given a treatment). Quantifying effects of interventions allows actionable decisions to be made while maintaining robustness in the presence of confounders. Here, we explore how causal inference can be incorporated into different aspects of clinical decision support systems by using recent advances in machine learning. Throughout this paper, we use Alzheimer’s disease to create examples for illustrating how CML can be advantageous in clinical scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss important challenges present in healthcare applications such as processing high-dimensional and unstructured data, generalization to out-of-distribution samples and temporal relationships, that despite the great effort from the research community remain to be solved. Finally, we review lines of research within causal representation learning, causal discovery and causal reasoning which offer the potential towards addressing the aforementioned challenges. },

Toward this aim mathematical modeling plays an important role in efforts that focus on predicting, assessing, and controlling potential outbreaks.

@article{El-Sayed2012-ac,
  abstract = {The past five years have seen a growth in the interest in systems
              approaches in epidemiologic research. These approaches may be
              particularly appropriate for social epidemiology. Social network
              analysis and agent-based models (ABMs) are two approaches that
              have been used in the epidemiologic literature. Social network
              analysis involves the characterization of social networks to
              yield inference about how network structures may influence risk
              exposures among those in the network. ABMs can promote
              population-level inference from explicitly programmed,
              micro-level rules in simulated populations over time and space.
              In this paper, we discuss the implementation of these models in
              social epidemiologic research, highlighting the strengths and
              weaknesses of each approach. Network analysis may be ideal for
              understanding social contagion, as well as the influences of
              social interaction on population health. However, network
              analysis requires network data, which may sacrifice
              generalizability, and causal inference from current network
              analytic methods is limited. ABMs are uniquely suited for the
              assessment of health determinants at multiple levels of influence
              that may couple with social interaction to produce population
              health. ABMs allow for the exploration of feedback and

  abstract = {Identifying biological and behavioural causes of diseases has
              been one of the central concerns of epidemiology for the past
              half century. This has led to the development of increasingly
              sophisticated conceptual and analytical approaches focused on the
              isolation of single causes of disease states. However, the
              growing recognition that (i) factors at multiple levels,
              including biological, behavioural and group levels may influence
              health and disease, and (ii) that the interrelation among these
              factors often includes dynamic feedback and changes over time
              challenges this dominant epidemiological paradigm. Using obesity
              as an example, we discuss how the adoption of complex systems
              dynamic models allows us to take into account the causes of
              disease at multiple levels, reciprocal relations and
              interrelation between causes that characterize the causation of
              obesity. We also discuss some of the key difficulties that the

              non-infectious disease epidemiology. We conclude with a

  abstract = {In Italy, 128,948 confirmed cases and 15,887 deaths of people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 were registered as of 5 April 2020. Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

The pandemic has increased the health and income risks calling for welfare state intervention. While increased needs, more deservingness, and higher state responsibility during such a crisis would suggest augmented support generally and among those at risk, this might be a short-term effect and cost considerations could reverse this trend. We study public attitudes towards four key social policy areas based on the German Internet Panel (GIP). We use three waves prior and further three waves since the pandemic had been declared in March 2020. The analysis shows both continuity in the popularity of social policies, in particular health and pensions, and some short-term increase in support for unemployment and family policies. The results after nearly 2 years suggest rather continuation with some thermostatic short-term boosts in support instead of any long-lasting change.},

Typically the available data are counts per spatial unit and the common approach is the Besag–York–Mollié (BYM) model. When precise geocodes are available, it is more natural to use Log-Gaussian Cox processes (LGCPs). In a simulation study mimicking childhood leukaemia incidence using actual residential locations of all children in the canton of Zürich, Switzerland, we compare the ability of these models to recover risk surfaces and identify high-risk areas. We then apply both approaches to actual data on childhood leukaemia incidence in the canton of Zürich during 1985-2015. We found that LGCPs outperform BYM models in almost all scenarios considered. Our findings suggest that there are important gains to be made from the use of LGCPs in spatial epidemiology.},

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.},

              while changes in the states of cells (i.e. healthy, infected,
              dead) are represented by a stochastic ABM. The two subsystems are
              intertwined: the probability of an agent getting infected in the

              frequently used for modelling many biological systems, including
              cell migration, molecular dynamics, ecology and epidemiology.
              Analysis of the model dynamics can be challenging due to their
              inherent stochasticity and heavy computational requirements.
              Common approaches to the analysis of agent-based models include
              extensive Monte Carlo simulation of the model or the derivation
              of coarse-grained differential equation models to predict the
              expected or averaged output from the agent-based model. Both of
              these approaches have limitations, however, as extensive
              computation of complex agent-based models may be infeasible, and
              coarse-grained differential equation models can fail to
              accurately describe model dynamics in certain parameter regimes.
              We propose that methods from the equation learning field provide
              a promising, novel and unifying approach for agent-based model
              analysis. Equation learning is a recent field of research from
              data science that aims to infer differential equation models
              directly from data. We use this tutorial to review how methods
              from equation learning can be used to learn differential equation
              models from agent-based model simulations. We demonstrate that
              this framework is easy to use, requires few model simulations,
              and accurately predicts model dynamics in parameter regions where
              coarse-grained differential equation models fail to do so. We
              highlight these advantages through several case studies involving
              two agent-based models that are broadly applicable to biological
              phenomena: a birth-death-migration model commonly used to explore

  abstract = {Causation is an essential concept in epidemiology, yet there is
              no single, clearly articulated definition for the discipline.
              From a systematic review of the literature, five categories can
              be delineated: production, necessary and sufficient,
              sufficient-component, counterfactual, and probabilistic.
              Strengths and weaknesses of these categories are examined in
              terms of proposed characteristics of a useful scientific
              definition of causation: it must be specific enough to
              distinguish causation from mere correlation, but not so narrow as
              to eliminate apparent causal phenomena from consideration. Two
              categories-production and counterfactual-are present in any
              definition of causation but are not themselves sufficient as
              definitions. The necessary and sufficient cause definition
              assumes that all causes are deterministic. The
              sufficient-component cause definition attempts to explain
              probabilistic phenomena via unknown component causes. Thus, on
              both of these views, heavy smoking can be cited as a cause of
              lung cancer only when the existence of unknown deterministic
              variables is assumed. The probabilistic definition, however,
              avoids these assumptions and appears to best fit the
              characteristics of a useful definition of causation. It is also
              concluded that the probabilistic definition is consistent with
              scientific and public health goals of epidemiology. In debates in
              the literature over these goals, proponents of epidemiology as
              pure science tend to favour a narrower deterministic notion of
              causation models while proponents of epidemiology as public
              health tend to favour a probabilistic view. The authors argue
              that a single definition of causation for the discipline should
              be and is consistent with both of these aims. It is concluded
              that a counterfactually-based probabilistic definition is more
              amenable to the quantitative tools of epidemiology, is consistent
              with both deterministic and probabilistic phenomena, and serves
              equally well for the acquisition and the application of
              scientific knowledge.},

  abstract = {As of August 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic has accounted for over six million deaths globally. The urban population has been severely affected by this viral pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns, resulting in increased poverty and inequality, slowed economic growth, and a general decline in quality of life. This paper proposes a framework to evaluate the effects of the pandemic by combining agent-based simulations—based on Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model—with a hybrid neural network. A baseline agent-based model (ABM) incorporating various epidemiological parameters of a viral pandemic was developed, followed by an additional functional layer that integrates factors like agent mobility restrictions and isolation. It is inferred from the results that low population densities of agents and high restrictions on agent mobility could inhibit the rapid spread of the pandemic. This framework also envisages a hybrid neural network that combines the layers of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for predicting the spatiotemporal probability of infection spread using real-world pandemic data for future pandemics. This framework could aid designers, regulators, urban planners, and policymakers develop resilient, healthy, and sustainable urban spaces in post-COVID smart cities.},

  abstract = {Today's most troublesome population health challenges are often driven by social and environmental determinants, which are difficult to model using traditional epidemiological methods. We agree with those who have argued for the wider adoption of agent-based modelling (ABM) in taking on these challenges. However, while ABM has been used occasionally in population health, we argue that for ABM to be most effective in the field it should be used as a means for answering questions normally inaccessible to the traditional epidemiological toolkit. In an effort to clearly illustrate the utility of ABM for population health research, and to clear up persistent misunderstandings regarding the method's conceptual underpinnings, we offer a detailed presentation of the core concepts of complex systems theory, and summarise why simulations are essential to the study of complex systems. We then examine the current state of the art in ABM for population health, and propose they are well-suited for the study of the `wicked' problems in population health, and could make significant contributions to theory and intervention development in these areas.},

              review key areas in public health where agent-based modeling has
              been adopted, including both communicable and noncommunicable
              disease, health behaviors, and social epidemiology. We also
